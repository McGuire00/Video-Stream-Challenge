# Video-Stream-Challenge

I turned in what I had as I was strapped for time. I did not get the chance the implement the back end. Project is no where near completion but with more time I could've had it up and running without a doubt. I hope to get a chance to speak on my coding abilities and how I would have finished the project. Thank you

- cd Video-Stream-Challenge
- npm install
- npm start

# Code Challenge

As you may or may not know, TalkMeUp is trying to help people improve their communication skills through real-time analyzing user performance in front of a webcam and providing instant feedback.

The challenge is how to send the video stream data to our backend in a reliable way when the user is making a video recording. Using HTTP post requests to send small chunks of data works, but it is not the best approach, because packets can be lost, or arrive in different orders through the transition.

The challenge for you is to:

1. Implement a webpage that a user can make a video recording through a webcam (you can choose whatever technology/open source libraries etc., but prefer not to use out of supported technologies, like Flash)
2. The user can upload the video recording to a backend that you implement. (You can choose whatever network protocol to upload the video)
3. Bonus. Take the challenge mentioned at the beginning into consideration when you explore ways to upload the data. If you can implement uploading the data along the way when the user makes a recording, that would be the Bouns.

Again, you are not limited to using certain algorithms or languages. Open-source technologies or libraries are welcome as long as they serve your purpose target well.

You will have 9 days to work on it (extended two days for the Thanksgiving holiday). It is totally fine that you can't finish everything because this challenge is quite open. In your final submission, please include:

1. A document that explains
   - your design of the system (both frontend and backend)
   - instructions to run your code
   - other comments, if any, that you want to share (like what kind of research you did, what obstacles you met)
2. Source codes, or GitHub link to your repo#
